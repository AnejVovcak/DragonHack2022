# DragonHack2022
Project of the Mavens team. The project received the Best process optimization hack award. My team and I developed a computer vision software solution that leverages Raspberry Pi and OpenCV library. It detects objects in the room and transmit their coordinates to a web server. It then displays 2D renders of objects in web application.
